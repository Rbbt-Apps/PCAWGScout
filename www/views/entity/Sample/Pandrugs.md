# Pandrugs report

This report is divided into tab considering the approval status of the drug.
Within each tab the drugs are listed with a text describing the status in more
detail. This description might include further considerations regarding the
applicability of the drug. Each drug is assigned a score, which is presented in
the top right corner of the drug section. This score is produced by evaluating
all the evidence collectively, positive or negative, and is used to rank the
drugs.

Each piece of evidence for a drug is related to the alteration in a gene,
severity of which is assigned a score which is presented alongside the evidence
itself. The scoring system takes into account several sources of evidence that
could indicate that the mutation has clinical significance or that it is a
potential driver, as well as the predicted role of the gene  in that tumor type
(tumor suppressor or oncogene). For more details please refer to  the [Pandrugs
database](http://pandrugs.org/).
