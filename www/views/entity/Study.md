## Overview

This report shows general information about PCAWG cohorts and allows to perform
several cohort-based analyses. The term study is used to refer to cohorts.

### Driver genes

We have two types of driver reports: the integrated cohort driver calls
produced by the driver group, and the sample level driver calls produced by the
patient-centric analysis group.

For cohort level donors there are driver calls for CDS, 3'UTR, 5'UTR, promoter
core, and enhancers (enhancers are regions not genes). These were selected by
considering the 0.1 q-value (BH FDR correction). These are semi-final results.

Integrated driver calls are represented under the driver incidence where the
donors where independently examined for alterations over the driver regions.
The annotations used here could be slightly different than those used by the
driver call, in particular promoter core regions. These are also represented in
the 'Cohort' driver network.

Sample level drivers are shown in the 'Sample' driver network. These results
are temporary while the final set is produced based on the final integrated
calls.


## Actions

There are a number of actions associated with each cohort that extend the
information with further analyses: functional enrichment, driver prediction,
summary tables, reports for genes and list of genes, etc.

You may access these actions using the controller on the bottom part of the
report. Some of these actions accept parameters. Remember that actions, like
any other report, are computed on-demand. Please be patient.
