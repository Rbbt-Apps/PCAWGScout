# Cohort selection

## Histological criteria

From this template you can access available cohorts, which are sets of donors
grouped by certain histological criteria. The main organization is based on
cohort _abbreviations_; these cohorts group tumors with the same main
histological type but which could have been provided from different sequencing
facilities. The project has provided official identifying colors that are used
across the site. They have also been the subject of analysis of different
working groups; for instance you will find driver calls. The second option are
the _Meta cohorts_ which group donors more generally, such as carcinomas or
lymphomas; these have also been examined for driver call. Finally there are
cohorts made around all four histology tiers and the tumor histological type;
for these you may still run some of the driver prediction methods available in
this site, but note that these are not as reliable as the official driver
prediction calls made by the project.

### Hyper-mutators

There are certain tumors that contain very large numbers of mutations, called
hyper-mutated, and which might negatively affect certain analyses. PCAWG-Scout
provides alternative cohorts without hyper-mutators accessible through the _NH_ 
links.
