# Cohort selection

## Histological criteria

From this template you can access available cohorts, which are sets of donors
grouped by certain histological criteria.

The main criteria to select cohorts is by _Histology abbreviation_. These
cohorts group tumors with the same main histological type but which could have
been provided from different sequencing facilities.

The second option are the _Meta cohorts_ which group donors more generally,
such as carcinomas or lymphomas.

Finally there are cohorts made around all four histology tiers and the tumor
histological type.

### Hyper-mutators

There are certain tumors that contain very large numbers of mutations, called
hyper-mutated, and which might negatively affect certain analyses. PCAWG-Scout
provides alternative cohorts without hyper-mutators accessible through the _NH_ 
links.

### Official cohorts and extended data

Some of the cohorts have extended data, in particular driver gene predictions.
These are all the abbreviations, except for those that have a small number of
donors, and the meta-cohorts.
